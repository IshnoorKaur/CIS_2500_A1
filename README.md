# Professor and Course Management System (C Program)
This C program manages information about professors and courses, performing various tasks using functions defined in givenA1.h. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

## Task 1: Reading Files

The program reads course information from a specified file using openFileForReading.

# Task 2: Displaying Course Information

Displays names and IDs of courses by reading information from a file using readCourse.

# Task 3: Displaying Professors and Courses Taught

Displays a chart of professors and the courses they teach by reading data from another file using readProfAndCoursesTaught.

# Task 4-8: User-Interactive Menu

Presents a menu (options 4-8) for user interaction, allowing them to find professors based on the number of courses taught, search for course names and numbers, and calculate the average number of courses taught by a professor. The program continuously prompts the user for input until an invalid choice is entered.

Note: Ensure functions like nCourses, getCourseName, getCourseNum, profsTeachingCourse, and avgNumCourses are defined in the codebase.
